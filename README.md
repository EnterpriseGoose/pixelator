# Pixelator
## A multiplayer pixel art editor

Welcome to pixelator, a unique way to make pixel art with other people! Used WASD to move, Q and E to switch colors, and press (and hold) space to paint. Make some beautiful artwork with a canvas that updates live with other peoples' edits!

To run locally, simply use `pnpm i` to download all the packages and then `pnpm dev` to run a dev enviornment or `pnpm build` to build a prod build and `pnpm start` to start it.
